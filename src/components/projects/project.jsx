            Project Shiksha : Imparting education to underprivileged children
            during Covid-19{" "}
          </h2>
          <p className="project_desc">
            In August 2020, schools in India were shut down due to rapid
            increase in the rate of covid-19 cases. As a result, most of the
            teaching went offline, and young children between the age of 7 to 14
            with no access to online resources of education were left helpless.
            Prayatan realised that the early learning years for children create
            the base for a stronger future for them and because of the current
            situation, many were missing out on these key years of education.
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of Project Siksha, Navya Mishra, Vrinda Jain and Aparna
            Khanna took responsibility for providing access to adequate and
            quality education to five disadvantaged children in their
            neighbourhood. Education was provided for all primary grade subjects
            along with a fun activity day each week for cultivating personal
            growth. Prayatan provided all stationary for these five children and
            ensured the health and safety of each child through a myriad of
            steps.

            Collection of funds for Priyanshu’s medical treatment{" "}
          </h2>
          <p className="project_desc">
            Thirteen-year-old Priyanshu’s journey to grade 4 one osteosarcoma
            was traumatizing for the child and his family. AIIMS Rishikesh took
            responsibility for his treatment but the road to recovery post
            operation was crucial and expensive. With both parents rendered
            unemployed during covid-19, Prayatan raised funds for supporting his
            post-surgical treatment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through their tireless efforts, Prayatan was able to raise over INR
            2,00,000 to pay for his lodging, nutrition and chemotherapy bills.
            Recently, two members from the team visited Priyanshu at AIIMS
            Rishikesh, with age-appropriate science learning kit, stationary,
            clothes and food. Priyanshu is a brilliant student and because his
            education was interrupted due to his medical situation, we arranged
            for NCERT books for his personal studying. His mother, who wished to
            support herself, was also helped by Mrs Asha Tiwari from our team.
            She was connected with a few shop owners to sell her knit-work and
            start her journey towards self-dependence.

            Oxygen concentrator donation for covid relief in Uttarakhand{" "}
          </h2>
          <p className="project_desc">
            In light of the current shortage in medical equipments, such as
            ventilators, ICU Rooms, oxygen beds, cylinders and concentrators for
            the entire Uttarakhand region, Raghav Juyal recently started
            #PLEASESAVEUTTARAKHAND for being able to collect enough funds to
            provide immediate aid to the state.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe that it is our personal responsibility at Prayatan to
            contribute to our state which is in dire need of covid-19 resources.
            The team was able to collect funds from immediate family and friends
            to donate an oxygen concentrator and smaller medical equipment to
            support Raghav’s cause and look forward to helping them in the
            future as well.

            Mannu Promod Thakur’s death at the early age of 29 due to covid-19
            left his wife and daughter with no means of income to support basic
            necessities such as food, clothing and education. The pandemic left
            the family in a heavy debt of 8 lakhs to be paid as Mannu’s hospital
            bills and disrupted the future plans of his daughter’s education as
            well.
            <br />
            <br />
            The pandemic has taken away loved ones from multiple families and we
            at Prayatan, aim to support the few that we can. In this uncertain
            time, we request your support in terms of donation for Mannu’s
            family so that we are able to pay off his hospital bills and start
            the journey of educating his 4 year old daughter. We have been able
            to collect ___ so far and every contribution from your end still
            matters.

            As part of our awareness campaign, we compiled a list of five
